# 🎨 Save App Icon Instructions

## Step 1: Save the Uploaded Image

You need to manually save the app icon image that you uploaded in the chat:

1. **Right-click** on the app icon image in the chat (the one with the teal arrow and "Affirm!" text)
2. **Select "Save Image As..."** or **"Save Picture As..."**
3. **Navigate** to: `/Users/dhani/GitHub/bePositive/assets/icons/`
4. **Name the file**: `app_icon.png`
5. **Ensure format**: PNG format
6. **Click Save**

## Step 2: Verify the Image

Check that the image was saved correctly:

```bash
# Check if file exists and has content
ls -la assets/icons/app_icon.png

# Should show a file with size > 0 bytes
```

## Step 3: Generate Icons

Once the image is saved correctly, run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /Users/dhani/GitHub/bePositive

# Run the generation script
./scripts/generate_icons.sh
```

## Step 4: Verify Assets

After generation, verify everything worked:

```bash
./scripts/verify_assets.sh
```

## 🎯 Expected Image Specifications

The image you're saving should be:
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Content**: Teal gradient upward arrow with organic leaves
- **Background**: Light mint green rounded square
- **Text**: "Affirm!" in dark teal
- **Size**: Should be at least 512x512 pixels (preferably 1024x1024)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The image file must be named exactly `app_icon.png`
- It must be placed in the `assets/icons/` directory
- The file should not be empty (check file size > 0)
- PNG format is required for transparency support

## 🔧 Alternative Method

If you have the image file elsewhere on your system:

```bash
# Copy from another location (replace SOURCE_PATH with actual path)
cp /path/to/your/image.png assets/icons/app_icon.png
```

Once you've saved the image correctly, the generation scripts will work perfectly! 🚀
