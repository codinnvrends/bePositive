## How We Use Information

Since all data remains on your device:

- Provide notification reminders as you've configured

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All data is stored in your device's secure local database
- Data is protected by your device's built-in security measures
- No data synchronization or cloud backup occurs
- Uninstalling the app permanently removes all data

### No Third-Party Services
Affirm! does not integrate with:
- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Cloud storage services
- Any external APIs or services

## Permissions

Affirm! requests the following permissions:
- **Notifications**: To send you daily affirmation reminders (optional)
- **Exact Alarms**: To schedule precise notification timing on Android 12+ (optional)

These permissions are used solely for app functionality and can be revoked at any time through your device settings.

## Children's Privacy

Affirm! is suitable for all ages. Since we don't collect any personal information, there are no special considerations for users under 13. Parents can safely allow children to use the app knowing that no data is collected or transmitted.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date. Changes are effective immediately upon posting.

## Data Deletion
